We wanted to create a game that could be both fun and useful for learning piano. 
Playing by ear, the name of the game, is a skill not everyone can develop naturally that is
also not taught by piano teachers, but play by ear can be an invaluable skill to learn.

Using this program, we want to help piano students to memorize notes of the piano, through 
intervals and chords, by repetition via copying. The keys play a sound that the student must 
relay by memory as well as trial and error. Over time, the student will rely on the memory of sound and associate it
with the keys being played, and after gaining confidence learning keys, they can choose to learn chords.
We hope that with learning basic keys and chords by ear it will ease learning of written music.
